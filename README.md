# CS50P_WEEK5_UNIT-TEST
This is week5 of the CS50P which was about the pytest, assert. AssertionError. pytest. Packages. __init__.py, this repo contains the project files that i have designed to implement the theoretical knowledge, I delved into testing Python code using assertions, `assert`, and the `pytest` testing framework. Let's explore the projects:

### 1. Vowel Eliminator

In `vowel.py`, I created the `shorten` function to remove vowels from a given string. To ensure its correctness, I wrote test cases in `test_vowel.py` covering various scenarios, such as handling uppercase, lowercase, mixed case, numerical input, and input containing punctuation.

### 2. Greeting Value

`greeting.py` features the `value` function, which assigns a value to a greeting based on specific conditions. In `test_greeting.py`, I crafted test cases to verify that the function assigns the correct value to greetings containing "hello," greetings starting with "h" but not "hello," and other greetings.

### 3. License Plate Validator

I implemented the `is_valid` function in `plate.py` to check the validity of license plate numbers according to certain criteria. To validate its functionality, I created test cases in `test_plate.py` to verify the length, order, format, and presence of punctuation in license plate numbers.

### 4. Fuel Gauge Converter

In `fuel.py`, I defined the `convert` function to convert a fraction formatted as X/Y to a percentage. Additionally, the `guage` function returns a fuel gauge reading based on the converted percentage. In `test_fuel.py`, I ensured accurate conversion of fractions to percentages and correct fuel gauge readings under various percentage values.

These projects enhanced my understanding of testing methodologies in Python, ensuring the reliability and correctness of my code.
